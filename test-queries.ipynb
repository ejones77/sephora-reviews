I have super fine curly hair that gets weighed down quite easily but now I’m using this after almost every shampoo, sometimes just by itself. It does not weigh my hair down at all, softens wonderfully, and tames frizz fairly well. I have yet to use too much. I also tend to get scalp build-up really easy and this doesn’t build up. Bonus is that it also works awesome for applying other scalp serums that might be thicker and harder to apply; thins them out and makes them last longer. And yes, it’s still wonderful on the face too!\n"

It’s so multipurpose and amazing!!!!I’m a user of the curly girl method (no shampoo, sulfates, etc) and this works AMAZINGLY with my hair routine! About once a month I shampoo my hair to remove build up (using Devacurl’s Low-poo) and follow it up with some deep conditioner and then apply this from my ears down. I have naturally curly, dry hair with some greys and this is AMAZING! My hair feels silky, springy and softer than ever! It’s a miracle in a bottle!On my skin is works miracles on my combination skin. My forehead is always intensely dry in winter and this has been a life saver! On my dry elbows-heaven!!I will keep repurchasing and recommending this product!\n"

I have naturally curly, dry hair with some greys and this is AMAZING! My hair feels silky, springy and softer than ever! It’s a miracle in a bottle!On my skin is works miracles on my combination skin. My forehead is always intensely dry in winter and this has been a life saver!

My skin stays moisturized and the cream doesn’t feel oily nor does it look too oily on my skin. It is expensive but a little goes a long way. Also have to remember to warm the cream between your fingers first before applying. Otherwise it doesn’t apply on as smoothly. It has a nice smell too. Just wished it was a little bit cheaper but will still use.\n",
